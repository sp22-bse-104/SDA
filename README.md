Low coupling is a design principle in software development that refers to minimizing the dependencies between different components or modules within a system. When components are loosely coupled, changes made to one module have little to no impact on others. This enhances maintainability, flexibility, and scalability of the system, as developers can modify, replace, or update individual components without needing to overhaul the entire system.

Low coupling is often achieved through the use of interfaces, abstractions, and well-defined communication protocols. It encourages a modular architecture, where each component has a specific responsibility and communicates with others in a clear, controlled manner. As a result, systems become easier to understand, test, and debug, ultimately leading to more robust and adaptable software.
